In this article, we will show you some of the features and benefits of Fabrication CADmep 2016. You will learn how to:

- Create and modify fabrication-ready models of piping, plumbing, and ductwork systems.
- Use manufacturer-specific content to ensure accuracy and compliance.
- Generate shop drawings and reports for fabrication and installation.
- Collaborate with other project stakeholders using BIM and CAD workflows.

## Creating and Modifying Fabrication-Ready Models
 
Fabrication CADmep 2016 allows you to create fabrication-ready models of mechanical systems using a variety of tools and commands. You can start from scratch or import existing models from Revit or AutoCAD. You can also use the Fabrication Database Editor to create and edit custom content for your projects.
 
Some of the tools and commands you can use to create and modify models are:

- The **Design Line** tool, which lets you draw a schematic representation of a system and automatically convert it to a detailed model with fittings, hangers, and accessories.
- The **Routing Solutions** tool, which lets you select from a list of predefined routing options for a system based on criteria such as size, material, and elevation.
- The **Modify** commands, which let you change the properties, dimensions, orientation, and position of components in your model.
- The **Grips** feature, which lets you manipulate components in your model by dragging their handles or entering values in the command line.

## Using Manufacturer-Specific Content
 
Fabrication CADmep 2016 comes with a library of manufacturer-specific content that you can use to create accurate and compliant models. The content includes pipes, fittings, valves, equipment, hangers, supports, insulation, and more. You can access the content from the **Fabrication Palette**, which organizes the content by category and subcategory. You can also search for content by name or code using the **Fabrication Browser**.
 
Some of the benefits of using manufacturer-specific content are:

- You can ensure that the components in your model match the specifications and availability of the actual products.
- You can reduce errors and rework by using components that are compatible with each other and with the system requirements.
- You can improve your estimates and bids by using components that reflect the actual costs and labor involved in fabrication and installation.

## Generating Shop Drawings and Reports
 
Fabrication CADmep 2016 allows you to generate shop drawings and reports for fabrication and installation of mechanical systems. You can use the **Drawing Manager** to create and manage drawing sheets that contain views of your model. You can also use the **Drawing Templates** feature to apply predefined settings and formats to your drawing sheets. You can customize your drawing sheets by adding annotations, dimensions, labels, symbols, legends, title blocks, and more.
 
Some of the shop drawings and reports you can generate are:

- **Cut Sheets**, which show the dimensions and details of individual components in your model.
- **Spool Sheets**, which show the assembly of components into spools or subassemblies for fabrication.
- **Erection Sheets**, which show the layout and installation of spools or subassemblies on site.
- **Bills of Materials (BOMs)**, which list the quantities and descriptions of components in your model.
- **Nesting Reports**, which show how to optimize the cutting of sheet metal for fabrication.
- **Labor Reports**, which show the estimated hours and costs of labor for fabrication and installation.
