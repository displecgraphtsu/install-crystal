The Zapatista movement is not only a local struggle, but also a global one. The Zapatistas have inspired and connected with other social movements around the world, such as the anti-globalization movement, the Occupy movement, the Arab Spring, and the Kurdish liberation movement. The Zapatistas have also organized various international gatherings and campaigns, such as the Intercontinental Encounters for Humanity and Against Neoliberalism, the Zapatour, the Other Campaign, and the World Festival of Resistance and Rebellion Against Capitalism. The Zapatistas have also received solidarity and support from various artists, intellectuals, activists, and organizations across the world.
 
The Zapatista movement is also a cultural and artistic movement. The Zapatistas have created their own forms of expression and communication, such as murals, paintings, sculptures, music, poetry, theater, literature, radio, video, and internet. The Zapatistas have also developed their own symbols and icons, such as the balaclava (ski mask), the red star, the black flag, the pipe, and the beetle (the vehicle used by Marcos). The Zapatistas have also used humor and irony as weapons of resistance and critique. The Zapatista movement has been described as a \"poetic insurrection\" that challenges the dominant narratives of power and oppression.
 
The Zapatista movement is also an educational movement. The Zapatistas have created their own autonomous schools and universities, where they teach their own history, culture, language, values, and skills. The Zapatistas have also invited people from other parts of Mexico and the world to learn from their experiences and practices through initiatives such as the Escuelita (Little School), the Caracoles (Snails), and the Juntas de Buen Gobierno (Good Government Councils). The Zapatistas have also learned from other struggles and movements through dialogue and exchange. The Zapatista movement has been described as a \"pedagogy of hope\" that fosters critical thinking and collective action.
